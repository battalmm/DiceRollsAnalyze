# DiceRollsAnalyze 
For homework, we were asked to take a fair-dice and score it 100 times to
record the results. We were then asked to perform various analyzes using these
results. We were asked to divide the data into certain intervals and calculate its
probability. We were then asked to roll a second 100 dice, this time averaging 5
by 5. Finally, we were asked to comment by calculating the error rates of the dice.
